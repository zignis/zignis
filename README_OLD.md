<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm HexM7</h1>

I am a person who learns most of the stuff by himself. I adore working with `TypeScript` and `React`. I also enjoy fiddling around with `OpenCV`, `TensorFlow` in combination with `Python` on my tiny SBC (Jetson Nano) hooked up with a "Kinect One" depth sensor, inventing impressive AR projects with it. I currently administer [Storiny](https://storiny.com), [@LorrenBurg](https://github.com/LorrenBurg), a Discord bot service named [@ProjectComio](https://github.com/ProjectComio), and an extensive service currently under development. I habitually work with `TypeScript`, `JavaScript`, `Python`, `C++`, `HTML`, `CSS`, `React`, `Next.js`, `Express`, to name a few. Ask me regarding linting anytime & I'll invariably suggest `ESLint`.

Apart from programming & technical essence, I am a cinematography hobbyist. I love cinema cameras such as the the `Sony Venice` series, `Sony FX` series (`FX-6` notably), `Blackmagic Ursa Mini`, the invincible `Arri Alexa` & `Red DSMC`. I know a substantial amount of color grading that I usually perform in `DaVinci Resolve Studio`. There's more to share regarding me, but I would like to keep things short and save some chunks of space on GitHub's database.
